TINT8
=====
A PDP-8 version of the popular tile-matching puzzle 
video game originally designed and programmed by 
Alexey Pajitnov. This version is very much inspired 
by the original made for the Electronika 60.

Current State
-------------
TINT is certainly playable but I would not call it 
finished. There is no use of a real time clock so the 
speed of the game is governed by a delay loop which 
might be need to be adjusted for your machine.

There is definitely need for polish in several areas. 
Patches are more than welcome and there is a TODO 
list in the code.

Building 
-------- 
I have buildt tint.pal with palbart 
version 2.11. Palbart should be compatible with PAL8 
but I have not tried it.
